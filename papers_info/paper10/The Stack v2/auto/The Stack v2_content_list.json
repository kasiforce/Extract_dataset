As of January 30, 2024, GitHub CoPilot has garnered over 1.3 million paying subscribers, with over 50,000 organisations opting for the enterprise version (MSFT Q2 Earning Call, 2024), estimated to increase developer productivity by up to $5 6 \\%$ as well as developer satisfaction (Peng et al., 2023; Ziegler et al., 2024).

Proprietary models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2023) and Google’s Gemini (Gemini Team et al., 2023) provide access to the model through a paid API but do not disclose development details. On the other hand, open-weight models like Code LLaMa (Rozière et al., 2023), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), and DeepSeekCoder (Guo et al., 2024) have released the model weights. This enables the open-source community to run these models locally, inspect the model representations, and finetune them on their tasks. However, the model developers have not disclosed their training data. Consequently, content creators do not know if their data was used for training, social scientists cannot scrutinize the dataset for bias and toxicity, and LLM developers lack information as to what extent the training set is contaminated with test benchmarks. More broadly, this practice hinders scientific progress as other research teams cannot readily reuse each other’s training data. Other LLM development projects, like Allen AI’s OLMo (Groeneveld et al., 2024), Eleuther AI’s Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023), and BigScience’s BLOOM (BigScience Workshop, 2022; Scao et al., 2022a), have adopted a fully open development approach by releasing training data, training frameworks, and evaluation suites.

The community previously released The Stack v1 (Kocetkov et al., 2023), a 6.4 TB dataset of permissively licensed source code in 384 programming languages. The Stack v1 includes a governance tool called “Am I in The Stack,” designed for developers to verify if their source code is included in the dataset. It also provides an opt-out process for those who prefer to exclude their code from the dataset. In December 2022, the BigCode community released SantaCoder (Ben Allal et al., 2023), a strong-performing 1.1B parameter model trained on Java, JavaScript, and Python code from The Stack v1. Building upon this success, the community further scaled up its effort and released StarCoder on May 4th, 2023 (Li et al., 2023).

In addition to code repositories, we curate other high-quality open data sources, including Github issues, pull requests, Kaggle and Jupyter notebooks, code documentation, and other natural language datasets related to math, coding, and reasoning. To prepare the data for training, we perform deduplication, create filters to eliminate low-quality code, redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII), remove malicious code, and handle opt-outs from developers who requested to have their code removed from the dataset. With this new training set of 900B $^ +$ unique tokens, 4 $\\times$ larger than the first StarCoder dataset, we develop the next generation of StarCoder models. We train Code LLMs with 3B, 7B, and 15B parameters using a two-stage training process (Rozière et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024). We start base model training with a 4k context window and subsequently fine-tune the model with a 16k context window. We ensure that the training process does not exceed more than 5 epochs over the dataset (Muennighoff et al., 2023). However, we push the number of training tokens far beyond the compute-optimal number suggested by Chinchilla (Harm’s law; de Vries, 2023) and train relatively small models within the range of 3.3 to 4.3 trillion tokens. We thoroughly assess and compare the performance of these models on a suite of code LLM benchmarks (Cassano et al., 2023b; Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023a; Lai et al., 2023; Muennighoff et al., 2024a; Cassano et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023b; Ding et al., 2023; Gu et al., 2024; Cobbe et al., 2021; Pearce et al., 2022; Dhamala et al., 2021; Nozza et al., 2021; Gehman et al., 2020), finding that: ",

We start from the annotations of the previous iteration that eliminated 36 out of the 300 extensions (of the 86 included programming languages). For StarCoder2, we only ran the data inspection for the not-yet-annotated programming languages (i.e., excluding the 86 languages of StarCoderBase). To streamline this process, we limited our inspection to extensions that include over 1,000 files and represent over $0 . 5 \\%$ of the files in their respective languages. The remaining extensions were retained without further inspection, as they only make up a small volume. With the help of 15 annotators from the BigCode community, we visually inspected around 1000 extensions and excluded 130 (see appendix A.1 for the complete list). Our data inspection step excluded 39 programming languages from the dataset (appendix A.2), resulting in a final count of 619 programming languages. ",

We start by systematically exploring the website from its initial URL listed in Table 2, using a queue to store URLs within the same domain. This queue expands dynamically as we discover new links during the crawl. Given that most documents comprise HTML pages, we focus our processing pipeline on (1) content extraction and (2) content concatenation. To extract the content, we utilize the trafilatura library $^ 8$ to convert each HTML page into XML format, simultaneously eliminating redundant navigation and index bars, elements that often recur in documentation. Next, we converted the XML format to markdown using our XML-to-Markdown conversion script. In the second stage, to compile these documents into a single text, we first do a near-deduplication of the content extracted from different HTML pages. This step was essential since we have observed that certain document pages only comprise website layouts (e.g., navigation bars) instead of fruitful information for documents, resulting in a substantial amount of duplicated content. To accomplish this, we treat each HTML page from a single website as a cluster and apply the minhash locality-sensitive hashing technique to identify and eliminate similar pages, using a threshold of 0.7. Finally, we assemble the gathered content from different pages of the same website in the order of web page crawling, ensuring a cohesive narrative. This parallels the “breadth-first search” approach, where all nodes at the current depth are explored before proceeding to the next depth level. Also, we collected code-relevant data from existing web crawls such as RefinedWeb (Penedo et al., 2023), OSCAR (Ortiz Suárez et al., 2019), and esCorpius (Gutiérrez-Fandiño et al., 2022). We use regular expressions to identify programming language-specific constructs within the documents and to detect the “docs.” substring in the page URLs. The resulting dataset primarily comprises content sourced from programming blogs, coding tutorials, and platforms like Read the Docs, with the exclusion of the documents gathered above. ",

We leveraged Llama-2-70b-chat-hf (Touvron et al., 2023) to increase the quality of the dataset as follows. We selected 20,000 examples and asked Llama-2-70b-chat-hf to rate the question-answer pairs. See Appendix A.6 for the exact prompt. Next, we pick the 10,000 highest-scoring pairs as positive examples and use the remaining 10,000 answers to create negative examples by randomly pairing them with other questions. We use this dataset to train a binary classifier by embedding the question and answer with a well-performing sentence embedding model (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2 $^ { 2 0 }$ (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019; Muennighoff et al., 2022a)) and minimizing the cosine distance between them. Next, we plot the embedding scores for a subset of the question-answer pairs and manually determine the threshold to 0.1.

Furthermore, we preserved 254GB of markdown data while reducing the size of HTML to 100 GB. This decision was driven by the anticipation that markdown would likely contain more code documentation, whereas HTML is commonly associated with webpages. Lastly, we subsampled data files like JSON, XML, and YAML to 8GB and a few other data formats to 1 GB. See Table 28 in Appendix C.2 for the full list of subsampled languages. ",

Each problem consists of a code snippet accompanied by an instruction of two types: descriptive or lazy. Descriptive instructions are systematic and provide detailed information, whereas lazy instructions are brief, direct, and mimic the typical instructions humans provide to code completion models. The goal is to modify the code according to the instruction; both lazy and descriptive instructions should lead to the same edit. The accuracy of each modification is assessed using a hidden test suite, and pass@1 is reported. The benchmark encompasses a variety of problems, from simple single-function, single-line edits to intricate multi-class problems requiring multiple-line edits in separate locations. Some tasks demand domain-specific knowledge like mathematics, and successful completion of a problem often requires the model to understand the connections between the components of the program. Listing 3 shows an abbreviated $^ { 2 7 }$ sample problem from CanItEdit with its lazy instruction. ",

We update the “Am I in the Stack” tool with repositories in new dataset.31 This tool allows for data inspection at the username and repository level. Marone & Van Durme (2023) recommend releasing a documentation artifact called a Data Portrait to support lightweight membership inspection. We implement one using Bloom filters to enable matching on file contents, crucially including the non-code sources like documentation, textbooks, and papers.32 These prose data sources may describe algorithms or solutions not present elsewhere. Content creators can use our system as a simple “no code” inspection tool to check if their material occurs verbatim in our data. It also enables a rapid first-pass attribution check for coding tools built on our models.33 This system takes about 70GB, substantially smaller than the data, but provides only exact matches for long strings.

When systems are developed in a fully closed manner, it is more likely for power to become concentrated among high-resourced organizations, and the small development team may not fully comprehend the impact and long-term consequences of the model being deployed. In addition, closed-development systems are often less auditable by external experts and can impede scientific progress since researchers cannot build upon each other’s work. On the other hand, fully open development allows for community research, democratizes access to the models, and enables audits throughout the whole development process. However, without appropriate guardrails, open LLM development poses a higher risk of misuse, as increased model access also increases the likelihood of harm caused by the model. Even though a released API can be shut down, once the model weights are released, it is nearly impossible to retract them. Discussing and implementing responsible AI practices has, therefore, been front and center during the development of our project’s LLMs. ",

Fortunately, there’s much ongoing research on how to improve the performance of Code LLMs on low-resource languages (Cassano et al., 2023a; Zhuo et al., 2023b). Furthermore, the predominant natural language in source code and other datasets used is English although other languages are also present. As such, the model can generate code snippets provided some non-English context, but the generated code is not guaranteed to work as intended or equally as well for all languages.

Chen et al.

Goldman Sachs (2024) suggest that AI has the potential to automate $2 5 \\%$ of labor tasks in advanced economies and $1 0 \\mathrm { ~ - ~ } 2 0 \\%$ in emerging economies, however, they also state that \"those fears should be counterbalanced, since AI has the potential to create new job tasks or categories requiring specialized human expertise\". Autor et al. (2022) reports that “Roughly 60% of employment in 2018 is found in job titles that did not exist in 1940.” and that \"augmentation innovations boost occupational labor demand, while automation innovations erode it\". Results from the task-based analysis in (World Economic Forum, 2024) reveal that jobs with the highest potential for automation of tasks by LLMs emphasize routine and repetitive procedures and do not require a high degree of interpersonal communication. Jobs with the highest potential for augmentation by LLMs emphasize critical thinking and complex problem-solving skills, especially those in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.

The Stack v2 is ten times larger than its predecessor, yielding a raw dataset of 67.5 TB. Through extensive cleaning, filtering, and subsampling of the source code, along with the incorporation of other high-quality code-related datasets, we created a training set of approximately 3TB (900B $^ +$ tokens). Leveraging this new dataset, we trained StarCoder2 models with 3B, 7B, and 15B parameters. Our extensive Code LLM evaluations, assessing code completion, editing, and reasoning capabilities, revealed that StarCoder2-3B and StarCoder2-15B are state-of-the-art models within their respective size classes. By not only releasing the model weights but also ensuring complete transparency regarding the training data, we hope to increase trust in the developed models and empower other engineering teams and scientists to build upon our efforts.
